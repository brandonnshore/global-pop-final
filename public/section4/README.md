# Section 4 Audio Files

Place your audio files in this directory with the following names:

## Life 1 Audio Files:
- `life1_song.mp3` - Original lullaby (Rorogwela) recording by Hugo Zemp
- `life1_narration.mp3` - Narrated explanation of the original recording and its cultural context

## Life 2 Audio Files:
- `life2_song.mp3` - Deep Forest's "Sweet Lullaby" remix version
- `life2_narration.mp3` - Narrated analysis of the remix and appropriation

## Life 3 Audio Files:
- `life3_song.mp3` - Example of global use or derivative work
- `life3_narration.mp3` - Narrated explanation of the aftermath and "schizmogenesis"

---

## How it works:
Each "Life" (1, 2, or 3) shows 2 audio players:
1. **Song Recording** - The actual music for that life
2. **Narration** - An analysis/explanation for that life

When users click "Next" or "Previous", the audio players update to show the recordings for that specific life.

If you need to use different filenames or formats, update the `src` attributes in:
`/section4/SectionFourMapJourney.tsx`
